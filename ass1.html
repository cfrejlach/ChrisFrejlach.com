<p> Fig 1.- A Journey to Mars</p><br>

<h1>Flying Lesson</h1>

<p>Watney is marooned on Mars and forced on a lengthy journey with the hope of rescue.
While the astronaut's path is fictitious, it takes place on real areas of Mars.
Watney's trek takes him across a wide range of remarkable Martian terrain, from flat
plains covered in deposits from Mars' watery distant past, to rugged highlands preserving
some of the most ancient land on the Red Planet. Mars Trek's bookmark for "The Martian"
allows you to follow Watney's intended path from Acidalia Planitia to the large crater Schiaparelli.
Waypoints along the route provide you with expert commentary from Jim Green, director of the Planetary 
Science Division at <a href= "https://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a> Headquarters in Washington.
